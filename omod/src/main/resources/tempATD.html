FAO occurs during prolonged fasting and/or periods of increased energy demands (fever, stress) when energy production relies increasingly on fat metabolism. In an FAO disorder, fatty acids and potentially toxic derivatives accumulate because of a deficiency in one of the mitochondrial FAO enzymes.</p></tr></table><h2 align="Center"><font color="#FF0000"><p>MEDICAL EMERGENCY - TAKE THE FOLLOWING IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:</font></h2><ul compact type="square"> <font size="2"><tr><li> Contact family to inform them of the newborn screening result and ascertain clinical status (poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy).</b><tr><li> Consult with pediatric metabolic specialist.<tr><li> Evaluate the newborn (poor feeding, lethargy, hypotonia, hepatomegaly). If signs are present or infant is ill, initiate emergency treatment with IV glucose. Transport to hospital for further treatment in consultation with metabolic specialist.
